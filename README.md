# Vulnerabilities-Management-Lab

Brief Descriptions:
- Installed and configured **Nessus Essentials** to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against **VM** hosts
- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus, remediated discoveries, and verified implementations
- Developed automatic remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software

NOTE:
- Details of Nessus Essentials and what I worked with can be found at <a href=https://github.com/vientrvn/Vulnerabilities-Management-Lab/blob/main/Presentation.pptx/ target="blank">presentation.pptx</a> in this repository

Motivation:
- Gaining an understanding of what is a vulnerability, what kind of threats it can pose, and the solution. If you are in tune with the Cybersecurity industry at all then you may know about the Schoolzilla data breach where 1.3M users' data were exposed and vulnerable to hackers, or the vulnerabilities that were exploited at Illuminate Education allowing cybercriminals to gain access to the companyâ€™s network and private databases.

- Just those two instances of many could all have been prevented by managing and mitigating the vulnerabilities. 

What is a vulnerability:
- A vulnerability is a weakness that can be compromised and can give unwanted access to outsiders to data/network. And the key is a robust vulnerability assessment program:
  - The program should be able to identify and quantify the security weaknesses, including application software, hardware, and network
  - Vulnerability Assessments should provide a clean, clear report of what in the environment needs attention and the level of priority
  - Exceptional Vulnerability Assessments provide a list of prioritized vulnerabilities by the system, software, and other important details
  - The list serves as a to-do list for IT security to improve its security posture by closing gaps attackers could exploit one by one systematically to reduce downtime or system issues.
